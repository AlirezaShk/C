Codings Samples
--------------------
Here are some samples of the codes I've developed for my research and career life.
##### Quick Overview
+ **C++**: During my bachelor's, I participated in a robotics research laboratory as a C++ and Python programmer; my 
tasks mostly revolved around video and image processing and data transmission between different systems using personalized 
data packets and APIs over Wi-Fi.
+ **PHP**: Many of the PHP projects I've handled are currently up and running and due to the security and privacy 
policies of their respective owners, I cannot give out the original source codes.  
    That said:
    + Here are two expired versions of my latest projects reachable via [this link](http://www.uoozet.com/). 
    + Another huge project of mine is the website of Iranian branch of [Hilti](https://www.hilti.com/), reached via
     [this link](https://madavi.ir/).
+ **React**: My favorite field in programming is backend development but frontend focused projects, developed using 
ReactJs is also one of my skills.
#### Final Note: 
_These projects don't encapsulate my full programming skill set or my limits. They are simply, samples of what has been asked of me
 by my clients or research tasks, up to now._
